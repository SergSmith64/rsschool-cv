## 3. Summary

I am a freelancer and I have been developing websites for 7 years and 2 years of which I have been working on Upwork.
During this time I had clients from different countries:

* Russia
* Singapore
* Sri Lanka
* Israel
* Australia
* Denmark
* Spain
* Romania

In my work, I use the tools most demanded by my customers: Git, Bootstrap, BEM, PHP, Wordpress, WooCommerce, Gulp, Webpack, SASS & LESS, Trello.
I had to perform functions Product Manager (PM), Team-Lead, Site Administrator, Designer, Programmer, Content Manager and SEO optimizer. I also had to completely negotiate with the customer, and calculate the price of developing the site.
Over the years, I mastered and with great pleasure I work in:
* SubLime
* phpStorm
* VS Code
But most of all I was surprised when I met with Microsoft Visual Studio Community!

I had to perform functions Product Manager (PM), Team-Lead, Site Administrator, Designer, Programmer, Content Manager and SEO optimizer. I also had to completely negotiate with the customer, and calculate the price of developing the site.
